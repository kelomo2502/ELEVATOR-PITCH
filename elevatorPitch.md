Hello, my name is Gbenga and I am a Full-stack Developer currently studying at Microverse, an online school for remote software developers where I’m training to use JavaScript, React, Redux, and Rails to build software solutions for a varying range of industries.
 
I have a background in project and construction management where I spent eight years collaborating with other built-environment professionals on delivering project objectives. This has given me the requisite experience and expertise needed for effective and efficient collaboration which is key to successful software project delivery.
 
I have used my newfound knowledge in software development to build real-life web applications such as landing pages for small businesses, a to-do-list app for high school students in my community, and a traffic management app for my local government transport authority among others. These new set of skills have made me a better team player, more deadline conscious, more creative-thinking driven, multi-tasking, and more conscious of diversity especially when working in a multi-cultural and multi-racial environment.
 
Your company has provided a wide range of educational and environmental impact assessment tools and would love to be a part of this team considering my background in the built environment and my software career trajectory in recent times.
 
I’m currently working on project scalability best practices and methodologies which happened to coincide with the project your company
is currently working on. I’d love to schedule a 20 minutes zoom call to share my ideas and findings. Can we agree on a time next week?
